この曲の「爽やかさ」は異常；

日本ではサイダーのＣＭに使われ
さらに「爽やかさ」が強化された

(Google translation)
The "refreshing" quality of this song is extraordinary; 
in Japan, it was used in a cider commercial, 
further enhancing its "refreshing" quality.

I Rick rolled my entire French class because we had to study a city in France and make a quiz about it as well as a presentation, I decided to make a Kahoot quiz because it’s very easy. I put a link in to this saying it’s the kahoot link. The teacher needless to say got very very mad. As well as my classmates asking who rick rolls in 2019
---------------------
They should turn off ads so that the rickroll happens by surprise...

WOW! I can't believe it! One billion views!! This is a very special moment for me. God bless you all, and hope there's more billions of views in the future!

OK, guys, I have a confesion: I was just copying what some memes from Reddit and YouTube already said, since it was a good idea. This is not an original comment...
